He was in his proud of the country, not in people of the country. This was because he refused the suggestion.

In the morning at 7:00 pm, there was still many people who took shorthand to one's paper in the mad mind. From this scene people could understand this world was like an inferno if they had knew the whole story. Nothing can be helped. Paulman said, "You know, It wasn't long before the government passed a bill. It means the day of judgement is coming. Soon you will see cliffs from many figures of economics.". He felt Paulman's sentences as if they had been epigrams that had made by some kind of saint. But then, they were the last things that neither influenced him nor mattered to him. Was he got tired from such an important and serious role that he stopped thinking of everything? No. Was he doing nothing but thinking of Pok√©mon GO? No. Quite simple. This is because his proud of the country was actually just a proud of himself. Also, it might be the true reason for him to refused the suggestion.

The first wave came. A heavy shock hit through trans pacific. It wasn't long before the wave reached north atlantic countries including U.S. The flood of disaster swallow all the people up to down. The cliffs were realized. As we say, "Inferno".

In Japan, there is still something like the Common Law. She, one of the                      , had thought of this big matter for a long, so long time. But for she it felt so short, and small thing. Because. Sun rises in the east, the earth is round, the moon is still looking toward us. But how about evaluation? They say, they always say, it's relative (In addition, the convenience is increasing and will increases from now on). But all of everyone who knows the truth including me know that it is still absolute. The sky I caught from the window is too shiny. It's time I left for home.

On the way, the ray from the sun felt straightly - I found it like a cheap ray-tracing algorithm - but no one knows how the word "YHWH" - it represents "the God" - pronunces. I start to wonder the destructions of the identities of things, in cluding me, suddenly, as if I were chased by blag big something. Somebody say that the destructions of sense - of course, "sense" includes pronunciation - are the destructions of things, like God. But I think we are in a world, in a kind, and also, to be political-correctly, in a value of oneself. Actually, their ideas are "cool". but it is no more than "cool". It doesn't matter. doesn't, anymore.

It was all of a sudden. At first, I couldn't recognize. And even now, I couldn't do completely without my death. It may be true that I was really chased and eaten by black big something. Even irrealis 'were' did nothing for me! Also, it might be bad that I was thinking so deeply. Anyway, my conscious is not remaining any longer, any more.
